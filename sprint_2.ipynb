    "This data was from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), a nonprofit international association of more than 1,500 public and private transportation sector member organizations. The main idea of all 3 datasets is to track, monitor, and analyze public transportation ridership trends throughout America over the years. The different datasets vary in the scope of data collected, with the biggest dataset tracking up-to-date ridership estimates each week for every partner organization. The other two datasets are more general, simply showing aggregate ridership numbers over the years, broken down by different modes of public transportation. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these ridership numbers do not account for every rider in America, they do a good job of showing pretty accurate trends within the industry. APTA is, afterall, a very trusted organization within the public transportation sector. These ridership values are modeled based on measures of Transit app usage (usage of these public transportation's app) to provide a current measure of demand for public transit. While these estimates do not represent actual reported ridership counts from agencies, however it was found that app’s user demographics generally match those of public transit riders overall, both compared to other common survey methods and available U.S. Census data."

    "Data1 (the upt_prediction csv) has a total of 41580 rows of data, which is a lot of observations! Unlike the other two datasets, this one also has many unique categories. There are 132 unique transportation agency's data within this dataset, spanning across 69 cities and 8 regions of the United States. Within these transportation systems, there is also 4 unique sizes of transportation services (from small organizations to organizations that serve over 2 million people). There were very few Null values in the dataset. I ended up dropping them due to there being minimal null values compared to the amount of observations, so it'd be best just to clean my dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data2 (the mode_quarter csv) has a total of 135 observations, which spans over 33 years of collected data, each broken up quarterly. This dataset did have missing ridership values within the first few years of the trolleybus column, I decided to drop these values. That data, according to the website, was left blank because those first few years the trolleybus ridership data was instead put into the \"other\" column. This is something to keep in mind when looking at graphs produced by this data later down the road. Looking at the basic stastical analysis of this dataset shows that there are clear favorites of public transportation method, that being heavy rail and bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data3 (the year_end csv) has a total of 33 observations, one for each year these past 33 years. This dataset also had missing values for the first few years of the trolleybus column. The reasoing was the same as cited above, so it is important to keep this in mind when doing data analysis. As stated above, looking at the preliminary statstical analysis shows that the most used public transportation methods would be heavy rail and bus. From viewing the ridership numbers, it is clear that the covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted ridership numbers. While ridership is on the rise post pandemic, it still has not reached pre-pandemic levels. It would be interesting to see this visualized!"

It is characterized by high speed and rapid acceleration passenger rail cars operating singly or in multi‐car trains on fixed rails; separate rights‐of‐way from which all other vehicular and foot traffic are excluded; sophisticated\n",

Light rail vehicles are typically driven electrically with power being drawn from an overhead electric line via a trolley or a pantograph; driven by an operator on board the vehicle; and may have either high platform loading or low level boarding using steps\n",

    "rail) characterized by an electric or diesel propelled railway for urban passenger train service consisting of local short distance travel operating between a central city and adjacent suburbs. Such rail service, using either locomotive hauled or self‐propelled railroad passenger cars, is generally characterized by multi‐trip tickets, specific station to station fares, railroad employment practices and usually only one or two stations in the central business district. Intercity rail service is excluded, except for that portion of such service that is operated by or under contract with a public transit agency for predominantly commuter services. Most service is provided on routes of current or former freight railroads\n",

    "Bus - The total ridership from bus, a mode of transit service (also called motor bus) characterized by roadway vehicles powered by diesel, gasoline, battery, or alternative fuel engines contained within the vehicle. Vehicles operate on streets and roadways in fixed‐route or other regular service. Types of bus service include local service, where vehicles may stop every block or two along a route several miles long\n",

    "Demand Response - The total ridership from demand response, a mode of transit service (also called Paratransit or dial‐a‐ride) characterized by the use of passenger automobiles, vans or small buses operating in response to calls from passengers or their agents to the transit operator, who then dispatches a vehicle to pick up the passengers and transport them to their destinations. The vehicles do not operate over a fixed route or on a fixed schedule. The vehicle may be dispatched to pick up several passengers at different pick‐up points before taking them to their respective destinations and may even be interrupted en route to these destinations to pick up other passengers \n",

    "Some possible UI components for this project could be a slider to progress through the time periods, a dropdown menu to provide options for filtering the data (looking at only heavy rail, or looking at only east coast systems), a text input to help select from the list of 50 avaiable cities, a button that would then trigger some type of update to the dashboard, and of course charts and graphs to visualize all this data.\n",

    "For data visualizaion, I see a line graph fitting very nicely due to the time x axis against a y ridership number axis. With this visualization, different colored lines can represent different filters (such as mode of transport or region). I also would find a pie chart intersting to see the distribution of different modes of transportation. I would also find it interesting to do a map to plot locations of transportation agencies and use sizes of said points to represent total ridership. Similarily, I could do a heatmap to show the distribution of ridership across America."
