Hello! This is my DS 4003: “Data Design Interactive Apps” term project. I have a passion and interest in public transportation systems, and America’s lack of public transportation angers me deeply. I, therefore, decided to build a dashboard that would aid in visualizing public transportation ridership data across America.

Building the dashboard involved several key steps such as data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, dashboard design, and user interaction. I go more in-depth for my process in these steps in the document titled Sprint 2.

Overall, building this dashboard has strengthened my skills in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard development. I have gained valuable experience in Python programming, particularly with libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and Dash. I now have more experience in UX/UI design.

One key learning experience was the importance of iterative development. As I received feedback and iterated on the dashboard design, I learned to prioritize user needs and refine the dashboard's features to enhance its utility and usability.

This dashboard was fun to create! Though I wish I had more time to transform it into something even better, I am quite satisfied with my growth from only one semester. Thank you both to Professor Kupperman and our TA Kayleigh for guiding me through the semester!
